Hi, thanks for checking out my repository.

This is a Newsletter sign-up form with a success message from www.frontendmentor.io.

I replicated this project to practice my Responsiveness & Javascript skills. This project was completed with HTML, CSS and VANILLA JAVASCRIPT only.

Features of the project.

1. User can add their email and submit the form.
2. User can see a success message in their email after successfully submitting the form.
3. User can see an error feedback message if the form is empty.
4. User can see an error feedback message if an invalid email format is entered.
5. Hover stats on buttons.
6. Mobile-responsive.


Below is a Screenshot of the interface.
